        <h2>Project: How are Emerging Economies transitioning to Renewable energy?</h2>
        <p>For my project I investigated how BRICS and MINT economies are transitioning to renewable energy.
            This question is important due to the necessity renewables in preventing climate change and to
            accelerate it, understanding the mechanics are paramount. I address 3 issues, how usage of
            renewables is growing, the relation between economic growth and renewables and the effect of
            depletion of fossil fuels on renewables.</p>
        <p>Both processing and analysis were handled through a central Colab workbook projectPython.pynb to
            centralise my work and to make it easier to spot bugs in my code I mainly accessed my data through
            the World Bank API Package in Python, allowing me to gain access to a range of different databases
            and time series for my chosen countries, whilst also saving my requests as Python code, improving
            reproducibility. Furthermore, the package had built in integration with Pandas, which I used
            throughout to clean and format my data.</p>
        <p>My variables of interest were percentage of energy output from renewables, GDP per capita and energy
            depletion savings (%GNI), which were saved as a list. This list was used to create a Pandas
            Dataframe for my chosen economies between 2000 and 2020, allowing manipulation such as rounding
            values, renaming headers and handling of missing values. This processing was done to allow for the
            data frame to easily be inserted into VegaLite for visualisation and SciKitLearn for regression. I
            also used data from the UNSDGâ€™s to measure international financial flows into renewables which had
            to be manually downloaded and added to the data set through a merge within Pandas, requiring
            alignment of indexes and key value pairs. This data was then converted to CSV and after addressing
            missing values, was downloaded and posted to GitHub.</p>

            <script>
                var myChart1 = "chart_renew.json";
                vegaEmbed('#firstChart', myChart1);
            </script>
        </div>

        <div class="chart" id="secondChart">
            <script>
                var myChart2 = "GDPLine.vl.json";
                vegaEmbed('#secondChart', myChart2);
            </script>
        </div>

        <div class="chart" id="thirdChart">
            <script>
                var myChart3 = "iffLine.vl.json";
                vegaEmbed('#thirdChart', myChart3);
            </script>
        </div>

        <p>3 time-series graphs were produced in VegaLite, showing GDP, proportion of renewables and financial
            flows for my chosen countries, however due to lack of data, Russia was excluded from financial
            flows. These showed temporal data in dates, quantitative in measurements and categorical in
            countries. Improve readability given the amount of series on the graph, an interactive overlay
            tooltip was used which showed the exact values along the series. </p>
        <p>Interestingly, GDP per capita was shown to grow as well as the financial flows, possibly highlighting
            both the wider importance on renewables and ensuring expansion of capacity as energy demand grows.
            However the proportion of renewables wildly differed between countries, with some like South Africa
            (ZAR) having close to 0, whilst Nigeria (NGA) obtained over 80% from renewables. Further, the
            direction of the gradient varied, with some countries share expanding and others falling, indicating
            country specific drivers likely play a highly significant effect.</p>


        <div class="chart" id="fourthChart">
            <script>
                var myChart4 = "scatGDPRen.vl.json";
                vegaEmbed('#fourthChart', myChart4);
            </script>
        </div>

        <div class="chart" id="fithChart">
            <script>
                var myChart5 = "scatDepRen.vl.json";
                vegaEmbed('#fithChart', myChart5);
            </script>
        </div>
        <p>To take the analysis further, I wanted to directly compare renewable generation with GDP per capita
            to see how energy mix changed when countries became richer and with Energy Depletion Savings to see
            if remaining stocks of fossil fuels as a proportion of Gross National income effected renewable
            generation. I chose to use the SciKitLearn linear regression package to do this. This required
            further manipulation of the data, in converting my DataFrame to fit the 2D requirement of SkLearn,
            which was done with the reshape() method and dropping of missing values. With this, the data was
            loaded and fitted, outputting coefficients for my data.</p>
        <p>Whilst I could have visualised with matplotlib, I chose to continue with VegaLite for consistency,
            which required generating a regression from the scatter plot that was made to visualise the
            relationships. This involved using a regression transform and I also calculated R-squared, showing
            the GDP per capita had greater explanatory power than depletion, which was near zero at 0.01. That
            said, By colouring countries, I could see clusters in both charts indicating potentially more
            powerful relationships for further investigation. This clustering implies an individual data
            generating process for each economy and high degrees of heterogeneity. That said, the relationship
            with GDP having R-squared of 0.06, may indicated emerging economies may not need to rely on fossil
            fuels to as great an extent to achieve prosperity unlike developed ones.</p>



        <p>In conclusion, my project produced effective visualization showing the challenges and heterogeneity
            of emerging economies transition to renewables. Whilst the aggregate statistical relations between
            variables of interest may have been weak, this was likely due to the differing characteristics of
            countries, as shown by the high degree of clustering in the data. This does present the opportunity
            to analyse individual countries in more depth, but to also include more countries in the sample and
            apply machine learning algorithms, such as k-means clustering, to categorise countries transitions.
            Further whilst single linear regression was chosen to aid visualization, combing multiple regression
            with feature engineering to select most impactful variables could provide greater insight, at the
            cost clear graphics.</p>
